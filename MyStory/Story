                            The mysterious game 
One morning Sarah saw her student suffering to get friends, so she had an idea to make him an
app that would cheer him up. So the next morning she took John somewhere special. It was where 
she learnt how to code. It was called Whitehat jr. He thought that it was so awesome that he asked her to teach
him. She was very pleased to hear him say that. She agreeded to do it. After a little while she taught him how
to make games. He was so happy that she taught him that. Now he started to show off his new skills and alot of 
kids started to become his friends. He thanked his teacher for teaching him. 
                                  The End.
